#### Frontend
Using Bootstrap, the ace c9 editor and some javascript elbow grease. I was able to make a reliable application that looks sleek and fine to use and communicate with.

Uses SQLAlchemy
and Posts, Requests and Comments all hail from a single table which then each type will have its own table havinf the original table as a foreign key,
