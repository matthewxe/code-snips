#### A code sharing solution that allows users to share and request code with a clean and intuitive look
#### Currently now live at: https://gravitationally.online

### Share code solutions with other programmers
### How its structured
#### Frontend
Using Bootstrap, the ace c9 editor and some javascript elbow grease. I was able to make a reliable application that looks sleek and fine to use and communicate with. It uses the APIs made in the backend to show all items safely, and I also chose a flex box as the main way of showing posts since it seems free flowing and nice to look around in
#### Backend
Using flask and many python utilities i was able to make a secure applications and apis to allow the front end to run as smoothly as possible, including pygment to highlight code blocks, and nh3(ammonia) to santize text, the apis are nicely secure with many checks, a
#### Database
Uses SQLAlchemy
A Yell (post, request or comments) are located in a single table which it has all the attributes to titles to likes and others, there are 3 other tables named posts, requests and comments that take Yell as a foregin key to inherit its properties from and each one now also has extra info like what filename it is.
The comments are collected which has a foreign key pointed to a Comment Set which comment set is pointed to a Yell, but that Comments are also Yells, so you could theoretically have an indefinite loop of going from comments to comment sets to comments agains which makes it very nice

#### how to deploy on your own

```

2. Run setup
